# Research-Data-Connectome-Project-
The goal of the Research Data Connectome project is to connect open research data (ORD) and make it accessible, interoperable and valuable for research, education and innovation. The Research Data Connectome will increase the findability, interoperability and reusability of open data and its impact on scholarly research and citizen science. By connecting data and service providers, this new research infrastructure contributes to the realisation of the Swiss National Open Research Data Strategy.

After two phases of planning and preparation, the project enters the implementation phase.
